Xiang-lian He was born in 1999 in Huai’an, Jiangsu Province. My father is a Chinese teacher. My mother came from a prestigious family. I have received traditional Confucian classic education since childhood. I am familiar with traditional Chinese poetry, classical literature, and historical books.

I have had a passion for writing since I was young, but I learned physics and chemistry under the exam oriented education system. Fortunately, I graduated from Jiangsu University with a major in Chinese Language and Literature. After graduation, I worked as a middle school Chinese teacher for two years.

But influenced by Beauvoir’s feminism, I want to become a strong and independent woman. So I came to Nanjing University to study Computational Communication. In the future, I want to become a technology worker, writer, or journalist. Most importantly, I have the right to choose and have a self consistent life.
