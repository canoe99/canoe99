1.Textbook tutorials, Junior high school Chinese textbooks

This is the most difficult course to teach because there are many classic articles, poems, and classical Chinese in the textbook. To teach a good text, one needs an extremely strong literary foundation and research in historical materials, poetry, and literary theory. I usually spend six hours preparing a text just to teach it well. In class, I also use diverse teaching methods to help students understand the article. After the lecture, I will assign rich writing assignments based on the characteristics of each article. With my efforts, not only have the grades and language literacy of students been improved, but what I am most pleased with is that their moral qualities and understanding of the world have also been enriched. My students told me that they love listening to me teach Chinese textbooks the most, and they always gain a lot from it.

2.Class management courses

This is a course rich in teaching art, covering many aspects of life, ranging from patriotic education to traffic safety education, and the location of teaching varies from time to time. Teaching this course requires teachers to have strong patience, resilience, and love. It requires teachers to play different roles, such as lawyers, judges, traffic police, etc., to help students become socialized individuals. Fortunately, under my education, my students have a good level of socialization.

3.Writing courses

I attach great importance to teaching students writing because it can help them perceive life, improve their thinking, and grow into a harmonious soul. The first is thematic writing teaching. I will first teach writing skills and examples to students, allowing them to complete their own compositions. Then, I will revise some compositions with better materials word by word for evaluation, letting students know the advantages and disadvantages of their compositions, and then have them revise them. The second is homework after class. I will assign writing assignments based on the characteristics of each text, such as rewriting classical Chinese, classical poetry, modern poetry, novels, etc. Students particularly enjoy such assignments because those who write well will be praised. The third is composition activities. I will publish some social news, academic articles, etc., lead students to read, and let them write their reflections. Some children will spend three to six hours, staying up until early morning, just to submit a satisfactory composition and write it very well. I think it’s not that students can’t learn well. If teachers can intelligently guide students to write, you will gain unexpected works. Perhaps in the future, some of them will be writers.

4.Commentary courses

This is a course that may sound dull, but it is very helpful for improving grades. I mainly adopt two strategies. For the knowledge taught, I will encourage students to actively teach in various ways to stimulate their desire for victory or defeat. For expanding knowledge, I will prepare lessons in advance, add many knowledge points, and let students learn how to draw inferences. Many literary classics can also help you with class management education, and you should learn to apply them flexibly.

My two-year teaching career has taught me a lot, first of all, my understanding of human nature and society. School is a small society, where small things make up the big picture. 90% of ordinary people make up the foundation of society, and only a few are extremely excellent. Secondly, I have learned to manage human nature. After all, humans are still uncivilized animals, imbued with many natural habits. We need to use educational methods to help them achieve socialization. Without thunderous means, we should not have a bodhisattva heart. It is normal for us to fight first and then bow. In the end, I became a more fulfilling person. I learned tolerance, understanding, and responsibility, as well as precious traditional culture, which will help me go further.
